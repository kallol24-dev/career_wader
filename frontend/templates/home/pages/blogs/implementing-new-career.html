              <p class="text-muted mt-3">The Josh Bersin model and the Career Diamond theory offer valuable frameworks for understanding talent development and career growth. By applying these theories in the Indian context, the potential of individuals can be unlocked, and a more dynamic workforce can be created.</p>

              <h5>Relevance to the Present Indian Context</h5>

              <p class="text-muted mt-3">Millions of students in India undergo education with low employability, and many are forced into traditional career tracks without adequate exposure to various career options. The existing career infrastructure is limited, with only a small number of institutions providing modern career counseling frameworks. The rapidly changing job market, driven by AI, gig economy, and hybrid roles, demands flexible and adaptable frameworks.</p>

              <h5>Challenges in India's Education and Career System</h5>

              <p class="text-muted mt-3">The Indian education system is exam-focused, limiting real exploration of unique skills and interests. Career counseling is sparse and often based on anecdotal success rather than data-driven insights. Careers are chosen based on perceived prestige rather than aptitude or market trends. Education lags behind the needs and trends of the job market, with an emphasis on rote academic learning rather than soft skills like communication and emotional intelligence.</p>

              <h5>Steps to Implement Bersin and Career Diamond Theories</h5>

              <p class="text-muted mt-3">
                <strong>Embed Career Education Early:</strong> Introduce career education from Std 8 onwards, focusing on exploration and discovery. Integrate career development into the curriculum, enabling students to make informed choices.
              </p>

              <p class="text-muted mt-3">
                <strong>Develop a Career Discovery Ecosystem:</strong> Partner with AI/data-driven EdTech platforms to personalize career pathways through analysis. Leverage technology to provide students with tailored career guidance and recommendations.

              </p>

              <p class="text-muted mt-3">
                <strong>Link Career Planning with NEP 2020:</strong> Align career development initiatives with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Ensure that career education is integrated into the broader framework of education reform.
              </p>
