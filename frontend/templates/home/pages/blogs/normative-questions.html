            <h3>Normative Questions for Career Counseling</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mt-3" style=" text-align: justify;">In career Counselling normally the two major ones to be posed in the form of questions/ offerings are: 1) Questions testing interests/ aptitudes/skills/ personality and behavioral and motivation traits to explore the self and 2) Offerings/ details presented to the candidate taking the tests, the options of study and employment related to their future career’s pathways/ careers/jobs. These are supposed to be the normative parts of career counselling. But there are lot of non- normative questions have also to be posited, and answers elicited, if the counselling is to be complete and correct conclusions and suggestions on careers are offered to them especially in the Indian context. As no such questionnaires are normally available, it’s better that at Career Wader, we must keep them as sets of questionnaires in post- test assessment sessions. I have posed them with the right prompts to get these questionnaires elicited. Some of these are applicable to only transitioning professionals and some others to even school goers too. Please keep these with any additions made to them at your end just like the pre-assessment questionnaires.</p>

            <p>Here's a suggested battery of questions for each of the 10 non-normative influences:</p>
